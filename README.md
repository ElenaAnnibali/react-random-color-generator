# Random color generator made with React

This modest version of a random color generator allows the user to create a random color by clicking the Generate button.
Another option for the user is to set the Hue and the luminosity.
The generated color hex code will also be displayed so that the user can copy it and use it if needed.

Style needs to be edited.
